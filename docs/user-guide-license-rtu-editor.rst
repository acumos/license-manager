License Right to Use Editor User Guide
======================================

The right to use editor assets a supplier and subscriber
create, review and restrict agreements to use models.

Steps

1. The right to use flag in the license profile indicates
that a right to use agreement must be setup in license
usage manager. The creator of the software will always
be able to use the software. No agreement is required for
the creator.

2. A supplier creates an agreement

    - for a target asset or asset collection (one ML model at
      a specific version to a larger collection of models)
    - with specific permitted actions
    - with specific prohibited actions (optional)
    - Supplier sends the agreement to subscriber.

3. Subscriber reviews and saves the agreement into License Usage manager (LUM)

4. Subscriber can optionally add restrictions on top of
the agreement (such which user names are allowed to use software)

The most basic Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL) agreement looks like this:

- Company A allows Company B to use face-detect-model at
  revision id edc76757-cd54-4256-9c3d-f865d88db1ff
  (no constraints)
  .. literalinclude:: ../license-rtu-editor/src/assets/exampledata/example006.json
  :language: json

- Agreement ready to be submitted to License Usage Manager
  PUT /api​/v1​/asset-usage-agreement
  .. literalinclude:: simple-agreement.json
  :language: json

Acumos Right to Use Actions
---------------------------

The Acumos platform is integrated with the license usage manager
to deny usage if agreed usage is out of bounds.
In the Clio release the following actions can provide a denial:

  - acumos:download
  - acumos:deploy

Other actions that can be described in right to use but are not
being denied are:

  - transfer (such as allowing solution to be federated again)
  - aggregate (allowing model to be added to a composition model)
  - modelrunner:predict (calling the machine learning model methods api)
  - modelrunner:train (allowing retraining the machine learning models
    in a subscription)


Enabling License Right to Use (RTU) in license profile
--------------------------------------------------------

When you publish a model with a license profile that indicates
right to use required. An agreement / right to use agreement
for the software must be setup using the right to use editor
and license usage manager (LUM) service.

License Profile indicating right to use required:

  .. image:: images/license-profile-rtu-required.png

Sample field in license.json:

  .. code-block:: javascript

    "rtuRequired": true

Here is a License Profile for fictitious Company B for square model:

  .. image:: images/license-profile-rtu-required-full.png


Step 1: Supplier Creates an agreement
-------------------------------------

Target software:

- Acumos solution ID is the software persistent id or
  (lum:swPersistentId) use this if you want to allow all
  versions of a model.
- Acumos revision Id is the software tag id or (lum:swTagId)
  use this if you want to provide rights for one or more version(s)
  of the model.
- The Catalog id is the common data service catalog id you can
  find in the url when filtering on catalog in portal
- The lum:swProductName is the name of the solution
  (this will match any solution by name)
- The lum:swCatalogType currently is for the public (PB)
  or restricted catalog (RS) - you just need to enter RS or PB.

Supplier:

- The Supplier Company name must match what is in the license profile
  company name.
- Please also enter the url of the company and email address.

Subscriber:

- The Subscriber name, url and email are required but are informational.

Permitted Actions:

- Please select actions that are allowed if you choose use then
  all sub actions will be allowed.
- Each action can have constraints by count or by date.
- If using date the format is YYYY-MM-DD or 2019-10-31 for October 31, 2019
- When using download action it will count any artifact download
  for a solution as a download action.

Prohibited Actions:

- Any actions you do not allow such as transfer the software to another party.

Download the file and send to the subscriber.

In our example we can create an agreement for square model
(solution id: b11dadf9-db03-43a8-94f4-e9f8155b8f42,
revision id: 9f603957-b720-45f4-8b8e-512d081e9a5f) which we received
from the URL parameters:
https://<ACUMOS_PORTAL_URL>#/marketSolutions?solutionId=b11dadf9-db03-43a8-94f4-e9f8155b8f42&revisionId=9f603957-b720-45f4-8b8e-512d081e9a5f&parentUrl=marketplace
using the RTU editor:

  .. image:: images/rtu-editor-agreement-companyb-companyz.png


Step 3:  A subscriber reviews and saves agreement
-------------------------------------------------

The subscriber can review the agreement by looking at the JSON or
by using the RTU editor to review the data contained in the agreement.

If you have lum service available under the same domain as the
rtu editor then you can submit the agreement directly from
the rtu editor.

  .. image:: images/rtu-editor-review.png

Add the user name in the last field and if rtu editor
has been configured to work with LUM
you can directly save to LUM.


Step 3:  A subscriber add restrictions to an existing agreement
---------------------------------------------------------------

This step is optional. A subscriber can use this step if they want to
assign team member's user names to the agreement or further narrow the
agreement's permissions and prohibitions.

You must know the Supplier's company name and the agreement Unique ID (or UID).

  .. image:: images/rtu-editor-restrictions.png

In this example we are adding 2 users consumer1 and consumer2 and
adding prohibitions of transfer and aggregation.


Troubleshooting Denial Messages
-------------------------------

Did the software get registered with LUM during publishing?

you may see this denial if software was published before license usage manager
was installed.

  .. image:: images/denial-message-no-swid-tag.png

– ie is there a SwidTag? yes or no?

If no republish the software or resubscribe to catalog.
If yes you may need an agreement.

If you don't have an agreement for the software you must get one from the supplier.

This is the denial message you will see if there is no agreement for the software:

  .. image:: images/denial-message-no-agreement.png

Do I need to create a new agreement with a software licensor?

There is no agreement in the agreement inventory that matches
this SwTagId or asset collections (SwPersistentId/SolutionId,
SwCatalogId, SwCatalogType, SwProductName, SwCategory).

Example agreement to resolve error:

.. literalinclude:: rtu-asset-usage-agreement-square.json
   :language: json

.. image:: images/supplier-company-b-agreement-in-editor.png

Do I need to have an amended agreement to include additional rights?

– Is there a close match such as there was an agreement
  for a revision id but now I need a new agreement for new revision.

Are there restricted rights that need to be amended?

Was the target restricted by the restrictions vs supplier agreement?


Right to Use Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL) agreement examples
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We have 7 different examples of license agreements:

- Use solution all versions no transfer, aggregate

.. literalinclude:: ../license-rtu-editor/src/assets/exampledata/example001.json
   :language: json

- Allow all software from a company

.. literalinclude:: ../license-rtu-editor/src/assets/exampledata/example002.json
   :language: json

- Allow all software from a catalog

.. literalinclude:: ../license-rtu-editor/src/assets/exampledata/example003.json
   :language: json

-  Allow all software from public catalogs

.. literalinclude:: ../license-rtu-editor/src/assets/exampledata/example004.json
   :language: json

- Face Detect Model - any usage

.. literalinclude:: ../license-rtu-editor/src/assets/exampledata/example005.json
   :language: json

- Face Detect Model - specific version can be used

.. literalinclude:: ../license-rtu-editor/src/assets/exampledata/example006.json
   :language: json

- Face Detect Model -  specific version, 10 users, expires,
  constrained actions, some prohibited actions.

.. literalinclude:: ../license-rtu-editor/src/assets/exampledata/example007.json
   :language: json

These should be customized for your licensing agreements.
The license rtu editor has a shortcut where
you can click on the example button to auto fill with these examples.
